1.Create VPC with 10.0.0.0/16
2.Create two Subnet(Public and private)
    ->attach created VPC
    ->give name
    ->availabilty zones does not matter
    ->give subnet range
    ->create subnet
3.Create Internet Gateway
    ->once created it will be in detached mode
    ->Goto Actions -> Attach to VPC
    ->select our vpc and click attach
4.Create Route Table to connect internet Gateway to subnet
    ->Give name
    ->attach with our VPC
5.We need to associate public Route Table and Public subnet to establish connection between them
    ->select public Route Table that we created
    ->under subnet assocaitions
    ->Explicit subnet assocaitions->Edit subnet associations
    ->select public route Table
    ->save assocaitions
    ->do the same for private route Table
6.Connecting Public Route Table with Internet Gateway
    ->select public Route Table
    ->Routes-> Edit routes
    ->add route -> Destination - 0.0.0.0/0 and Target - Internet Gateway->select created Gateway
    ->save changes
7.Create Security groups(public and private)
    ->Go to security group
    ->Give name
    ->select our VPC
    ->inbound rules ->SSH-22port->RDP-3389port->HTTP-80port
    ->click create security group
    ->copy the security group ID
    ->create private security group
    ->select our VPC
    ->inbound rules -> All TCP ->paste the public security group id in source
8.Create webserver in public and DB in private
    ->Launch Ec2 instance for both
    ->select our VPC
    ->Enable Auto-assign public IP
    ->select public security group
    ->Launch
    ->Launch EC2 for DB with private
    ->Diable Auto-assign public IP
    ->login to public server
    ->after logged in with webserver goto RDC and connect the DB server(Private)
    ->webserver with internet connection and DB without internet
9.Create NAT Gateway for providing internet to intranet
    ->Create NAT Gateway
    ->give name
    ->choose public subnet
    ->Allocate Elastic IP
    ->click create NAT Gateway to complete the creation process
    ->Once NAT Gateway turned to available
10.Connecting NAT with Private Route Table
    ->Goto Route Table
    ->Select private Route Table
    ->under Routes select edit routes
    ->Add route ->Destination - 0.0.0.0/0 and target - NAT gateway
    ->save changes


Deleting VPC
1.Delete NAT gateway
2.Terminate both the servers
3.Delete VPC
4.Release Elastic IP
